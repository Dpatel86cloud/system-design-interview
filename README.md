## What is system design?

The process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. [System design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design) could be seen as the application of systems theory to product environment.

## Step by step how to approach a system design interview question

### Step 1: Constraints and use cases

Gather as much information as possible before starting your design

* Clarify the system's constraints
* Identify what use cases the system needs to satisfy
* Questioning your interviewer and agreeing on the scope of the system
* Never assume things that were not explicitly stated
* How many users does your system serve?
* What are the I/O(input/output) of the system?
* How many requests per second do we expect?
* How does your system handle if more users use your service?
* What is the expected read to write ratio?
* How large is the data? How can we handle them?

### Step 2: Draw a high level design

Outlining all the important components that your architecture will need

* Draw a simple diagram of your ideas
* Sketch main components and the connections between them
* Justify your high-level design diagram
* Use well-known developed techniques

### Step 3: Design core components

Dive into details for each core component.  For example, if you were asked to design a url shortening service, discuss:

* Generating and storing a hash of the full url
    * MD5 and Base62
    * Hash collisions
    * SQL or NoSQL
    * Database schema
* Translating a hashed url to the full url
    * Database lookup
* API and object-oriented design

### Step 4: Scale the design

Identify and address bottlenecks, given the constraints.  For example, do you need the following to address scalability issues?

* Load balancer
* Horizontal scaling
* Caching
* Database sharding

Discuss potential solutions and trade-offs.  Everything is a trade-off.

### Availability patterns

There are two main patterns to support high availability: **fail-over** and **replication**.

### Fail-over

#### Active-passive

With active-passive fail-over, heartbeats are sent between the active and the passive server on standby.  If the heartbeat is interrupted, the passive server takes over the active's IP address and resumes service.

The length of downtime is determined by whether the passive server is already running in 'hot' standby or whether it needs to start up from 'cold' standby.  Only the active server handles traffic.

Active-passive failover can also be referred to as master-slave failover.

#### Active-active

In active-active, both servers are managing traffic, spreading the load between them.

If the servers are public-facing, the DNS would need to know about the public IPs of both servers.  If the servers are internal-facing, application logic would need to know about both servers.

Active-active failover can also be referred to as master-master failover.

#### Disadvantage(s): failover

* Fail-over adds more hardware and additional complexity.
* There is a potential for loss of data if the active system fails before any newly written data can be replicated to the passive.

#### Replication

Master-slave and master-master

* Master-slave replication
  * Master serves reads and writes, replicating writes to one or more slaves.
  * Slaves serves only reads, can replicate to additional slaves in a tree-like fashion.
  * If the master goes offline, the system can continue to operate in read-only mode until a slave is promoted to a master or a new master is provisioned.
  * **Disadvanges(s):**
    * Additional logic is needed to promote a slave to a master.

* Master-master replication
  * Both masters serve reads and writes and coordinate with each other on writes.
  * If either master goes down, the system can continue to operate with both reads and writes.
  * **Disadvantage(s):**
    * You'll need a load balancer or you'll need to make changes to your application logic to determine where to write.
    * Most master-master systems are either loosely consistent (violating ACID) or have increased write latency due to synchronization.
    * Conflict resolution comes more into play as more write nodes are added and as latency increases.

* **Replication disadvantage(s):**
  * There is a potential for loss of data if the master fails before any newly written data can be replicated to other nodes.
  * Writes are replayed to the read replicas. If there are a lot of writes, the read replicas can get bogged down with replaying writes and can't do as many reads.
  * The more read slaves, the more you have to replicate, which leads to greater replication lag.
  * On some systems, writing to the master can spawn multiple threads to write in parallel, whereas read replicas only support writing sequentially with a single thread.
  * Replication adds more hardware and additional complexity.


### Domain name system

</p>

A Domain Name System (DNS) translates a domain name such as www.example.com to an IP address.

DNS is hierarchical, with a few authoritative servers at the top level.  Your router or ISP provides information about which DNS server(s) to contact when doing a lookup.  Lower level DNS servers cache mappings, which could become stale due to DNS propagation delays.  DNS results can also be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the [time to live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live).

* **NS record (name server)** - Specifies the DNS servers for your domain/subdomain.
* **MX record (mail exchange)** - Specifies the mail servers for accepting messages.
* **A record (address)** - Points a name to an IP address.
* **CNAME (canonical)** - Points a name to another name or `CNAME` (example.com to www.example.com) or to an `A` record.

Services such as [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/) and [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) provide managed DNS services.  Some DNS services can route traffic through various methods:

* [Weighted round robin](http://g33kinfo.com/info/archives/2657)
    * Prevent traffic from going to servers under maintenance
    * Balance between varying cluster sizes
    * A/B testing
* Latency-based
* Geolocation-based

### Disadvantage(s): DNS

* Accessing a DNS server introduces a slight delay, although mitigated by caching described above.
* DNS server management could be complex, although they are generally managed by [governments, ISPs, and large companies](http://superuser.com/questions/472695/who-controls-the-dns-servers/472729).
* DNS services have recently come under [DDoS attack](http://dyn.com/blog/dyn-analysis-summary-of-friday-october-21-attack/), preventing users from accessing websites such as Twitter without knowing Twitter's IP address(es).

### Content delivery network

<p align="center">

  <br/>
  <i><a href=https://www.creative-artworks.eu/why-use-a-content-delivery-network-cdn/>Source: Why use a CDN</a></i>
</p>

A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers, serving content from locations closer to the user.  Generally, static files such as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content.  The site's DNS resolution will tell clients which server to contact.

Serving content from CDNs can significantly improve performance in two ways:

* Users receive content at data centers close to them
* Your servers do not have to serve requests that the CDN fulfills

### Push CDNs

Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server.  You take full responsibility for providing content, uploading directly to the CDN and rewriting URLs to point to the CDN.  You can configure when content expires and when it is updated.  Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.

Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn't often updated work well with push CDNs.  Content is placed on the CDNs once, instead of being re-pulled at regular intervals.

### Pull CDNs

Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.  You leave the content on your server and rewrite URLs to point to the CDN.  This results in a slower request until the content is cached on the CDN.

A [time-to-live (TTL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) determines how long content is cached.  Pull CDNs minimize storage space on the CDN, but can create redundant traffic if files expire and are pulled before they have actually changed.

Sites with heavy traffic work well with pull CDNs, as traffic is spread out more evenly with only recently-requested content remaining on the CDN.

### Disadvantage(s): CDN

* CDN costs could be significant depending on traffic, although this should be weighed with additional costs you would incur not using a CDN.
* Content might be stale if it is updated before the TTL expires it.
* CDNs require changing URLs for static content to point to the CDN.

### CAP theorem

<p align="center">

  <i><a href=http://robertgreiner.com/2014/08/cap-theorem-revisited>Source: CAP theorem revisited</a></i>
</p>

In a distributed computer system, you can only support two of the following guarantees:

* **Consistency** - Every read receives the most recent write or an error
* **Availability** - Every request receives a response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent version of the information
* **Partition Tolerance** - The system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures

*Networks aren't reliable, so you'll need to support partition tolerance.  You'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.*

#### CP - consistency and partition tolerance

Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error.  CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.

#### AP - availability and partition tolerance

Responses return the most recent version of the data available on the a node, which might not be the latest.  Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for [eventual consistency](#eventual-consistency) or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.

### Load balancer

<p align="center">

</p>

Load balancers distribute incoming client requests to computing resources such as application servers and databases.  In each case, the load balancer returns the response from the computing resource to the appropriate client.  Load balancers are effective at:

* Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
* Preventing overloading resources
* Helping eliminate single points of failure

Load balancers can be implemented with hardware (expensive) or with software such as HAProxy.

Additional benefits include:

* **SSL termination** - Decrypt incoming requests and encrypt server responses so backend servers do not have to perform these potentially expensive operations
    * Removes the need to install [X.509 certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) on each server
* **Session persistence** - Issue cookies and route a specific client's requests to same instance if the web apps do not keep track of sessions

To protect against failures, it's common to set up multiple load balancers, either in [active-passive](#active-passive) or [active-active](#active-active) mode.

Load balancers can route traffic based on various metrics, including:

* Random
* Least loaded
* Session/cookies
* [Round robin or weighted round robin](http://g33kinfo.com/info/archives/2657)
* [Layer 4](#layer-4-load-balancing)
* [Layer 7](#layer-7-load-balancing)

### Layer 4 load balancing

Layer 4 load balancers look at info at the [transport layer](#communication) to decide how to distribute requests.  Generally, this involves the source, destination IP addresses, and ports in the header, but not the contents of the packet.  Layer 4 load balancers forward network packets to and from the upstream server, performing [Network Address Translation (NAT)](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/layer-4-load-balancing/).

### Layer 7 load balancing

Layer 7 load balancers look at the [application layer](#communication) to decide how to distribute requests.  This can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies.  Layer 7 load balancers terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server.  For example, a layer 7 load balancer can direct video traffic to servers that host videos while directing more sensitive user billing traffic to security-hardened servers.

At the cost of flexibility, layer 4 load balancing requires less time and computing resources than Layer 7, although the performance impact can be minimal on modern commodity hardware.

### Horizontal scaling

Load balancers can also help with horizontal scaling, improving performance and availability.  Scaling out using commodity machines is more cost efficient and results in higher availability than scaling up a single server on more expensive hardware, called **Vertical Scaling**.  It is also easier to hire for talent working on commodity hardware than it is for specialized enterprise systems.

#### Disadvantage(s): horizontal scaling

* Scaling horizontally introduces complexity and involves cloning servers
    * Servers should be stateless: they should not contain any user-related data like sessions or profile pictures
    * Sessions can be stored in a centralized data store such as a [database](#database) (SQL, NoSQL) or a persistent [cache](#cache) (Redis, Memcached)
* Downstream servers such as caches and databases need to handle more simultaneous connections as upstream servers scale out

### Disadvantage(s): load balancer

* The load balancer can become a performance bottleneck if it does not have enough resources or if it is not configured properly.
* Introducing a load balancer to help eliminate single points of failure results in increased complexity.
* A single load balancer is a single point of failure, configuring multiple load balancers further increases complexity.

You'll sometimes be asked to do 'back-of-the-envelope' estimates.  For example, you might need to determine how long it will take to generate 100 image thumbnails from disk or how much memory a data structure will take.  The **Powers of two table** and **Latency numbers every programmer should know** are handy references.

Handy metrics based on numbers above:

* Read sequentially from disk at 30 MB/s
* Read sequentially from 1 Gbps Ethernet at 100 MB/s
* Read sequentially from SSD at 1 GB/s
* Read sequentially from main memory at 4 GB/s
* 6-7 world-wide round trips per second
* 2,000 round trips per second within a data center
